Hello, Iâ€™m Samuel Jacobson, Computer Science - Applied major at Eastern Michigan University.

Most of my experience thus far is in Java programming, but I have also learnt the basics of C, C++, C#, Python, Lisp, Swift, HTML/JavaScript/CSS, R, and Processing.

I hope to participate in summer internship opportunities near the Ypsilanti/Ann Arbor area.
